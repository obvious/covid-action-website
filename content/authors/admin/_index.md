The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global emergency that requires immediate action by governments, individuals and businesses. All of us have a key role to play in minimising transmission. Early, bold and effective action will reduce short- term risks to employees and long-term costs to businesses and the  economy. This calls for unprecedented collaboration to Act + Collaborate.

## Act

The COVID 19 Collaborative has developed an Action framework, that is based on evidence and experience.  This can be applied by anyone, anywhere coordinating a response - at hyper-localised communities all the way up to Districts, State, Regional, National levels.  

Central to the framework is a calibrated action which continuously reads the local situation (using tools) and integrates various resources and actions including Finance, Information, Human resources, Materials, Infrastructure and equipment. In each area, we have three key continuous actions - Estimate, Mobilise, Deploy.

Through all of this, We aim to rapidly and cost effectively:

* Prevent new infections
* Diagnose early
* Treat appropriately and care
* Mitigate any other impacts

## Collaborate

#CovidActionCollab is a group of individuals and organisations across public, private, civil society, academia with expertise in Public Health, Medicine, Technology, Sociology, Behavioural science, Finance, Humanitarian Emergencies, Supply Chain Management, Designers, and more. CoVID-19 has already demonstrated that it has no regard for borders, or groups. We have to work together to respond effectively.
