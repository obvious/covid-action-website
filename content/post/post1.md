Swasti teams are currently working to minimize the potential impact of global health emergencies where we work.

See what we've been upto for the last ten days:

For our people

For our communities

As a Public Health organization, times like these are clarion calls to step up, to protect our communities and health workers and their families alike. It also calls for us to accelerate and enhance our actions in public health, social development, humanitarian aid, governance and more.

Being at these critical intersections means we are presented with an incredibly unique opportunity to collaborate in a holistic response.

We are leveraging our experience of working in humanitarian emergencies to develop and promote

THE COVID-19 (RESPONSE) ACTION COLLABORATIVE

The Collaborative aims to support stakeholders to collaborate, coordinate and integrate the Covid-19 Response.

The framework, tools, and actions are fast evolving and we would love to collaborate with you. You will find some of these on the right panel of this page, with more in the pipeline.

While we hope for the best, we know that we must prepare for the worst and hence if you are interested in engaging, here is what you can do:

Use: If you would like to use our framework as a strategy for a response, feel free to use it. As it will be constantly updated and you will get access to all the tools and other resources that we are rapidly putting together. You can use the framework at any level – National, State/Province, District, Taluk, Gram Panchayat, Resident Welfare Association, etc. We expect to have a public platform available shortly.

Contribute: in two ways

If you have any tools, training materials, technology or any other resources – Please contribute to our effort; we will ensure everyone who uses this platform gets access.
If you have financial or other material resources that you want to contribute; do share your thinking with us; we will help you deploy them well.

Seek: resources (materials, tools, technologies) – these should be up on the platform soon.

Feel free to socialize this page and its contents with your partners, friends, and associates – who you think may be interested.
